# observable README

This is a basic notify-listen framework on top of wxWidgets (wxW).

There are three out of the box use cases:

1:: The event variable depends on a variable which is visible on both
    the listener and notifying side. It is described in the
    *observable_evtvar.h* header.

2:: The config variable mechanism allows for listening to configuraion
    variable changes, and to notify about such changes. It is described
    in the *observable_confvar.h* header

3:: The global variable mechanism (sic!) allows for listening to global
    variable changes and to notify about such changes. It is described in 
    the *observable_globvar.h* header.

The framework is developed in the opencpn project [1]. 

## Extending

It is easy to extend the framework to handle other types. The basic condition
is that anything which should be handled by `Listen()` and `Notify()` must 
be able to produce a key. The key is an unique string which is used to 
synchronize the notify and listen side; the key used when listening must be 
the same as used when notifying.

The event variable described above uses an auto generated random key, this
works since both sides knows about the same event variable.

The config variable uses a key derived from the configuration value name.
This works since both sides knows the name (path) to the configuration
variable.

In the OpenCPN project the framework is extended to handle messages. Each
message is capable of generating a key based on it's type. This makes is
possible to listen for specific message types as well as notifying when
such a message is received.
